# Budget Tracker CLI

The Budget Tracker CLI is a Python-based command-line application designed to help you manage your finances and track your expenses easily. This tool utilizes the SQLAlchemy library for database management and provides various features to handle your financial data effectively.

## Installation

To use the Budget Tracker CLI, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository to your local computer:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mohamedmhussein/python-p3-cli-project-budget-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```console
   cd <app_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pipenv:

   ```console
   pipenv install
   ```

## Usage

To run the app, you need to write the following commands:

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```console
   pipenv shell
   ```

2. Run the CLI script:

   ```console
   python lib/cli.py
   ```

The CLI will display a menu with various options for managing your financial data. You can select options to add expenses, create categories, sort expenses, calculate sums, and more. The menu-driven interface makes it easy to interact with the application and perform different financial tasks.

### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit
(you can ignore your Alembic files) should get at least a paragraph. Each
function should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of
detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably
functions next, then models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a good CLI, but it all relies on concepts that you've
practiced quite a bit by now. Hopefully this template and guide will get you
off to a good start with your Phase 3 Project.

Happy coding!
